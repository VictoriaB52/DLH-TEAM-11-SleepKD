## Original Paper: Teacher Assistant-Based Knowledge Distillation Extracting Multi-level Features on Single Channel Sleep EEG
Link to Original Repo: https://github.com/HychaoWang/SleepKD

The SleepKD knowledge distillation method was tested on two models: SalientSleepNet and DeepSleepNet. I was only able to do work
on DeepSleepNet so far. All of the files in the deepsleepnet folder are created by the authors of DeepSleepNet: a Model for Automatic Sleep Stage
Scoring based on Raw Single-Channel EEG. The source code can be found at 
https://github.com/akaraspt/deepsleepnet/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file Additionally, the data folder containts the results
of running the DeepSleepNet file prepare_phsionet.py. It is contained in. the main folder for ease of access, but it is also
not a result of any preprocessing I wrote myself. 

Any files that I wrote myself and their resulting outputs are found in the DLH Custom Files Folder.
